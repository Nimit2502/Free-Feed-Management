Food Donation is a mission to end hunger and no wasting of food to make a hunger-free world.
According to the latest survey, 1.3 billion tons of food is thrown as waste every year. Additionally, one-third of the
food consumed is stated as leftovers. The focus of this project is to reduce the amount of food wasted and being
used to the needy people. Therefore, an NGO website is developed by which a person can donate food as per
their capacity.
At first, a person who wishes to join the website as a donor or volunteer will need to register himself.Then after,
donor can post a donation request with all the information related to it.
Admin will notify all the volunteers in the area and whomsoever wishes to volunteer can accept the request.If
there is zero acceptance, the process ends there, else it will move further with volunteers going and picking up
food and distributing it to needy ones.
